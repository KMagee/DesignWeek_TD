Design Review 2
===============
You can explore a completed Angular project. (I already downloaded the node modules)
All the angular documentation is here: https://angular.io/docs
(NB you can ignore messages about 'your global angular cli version...')

Stop any command-line server you might have already runnig with ctrl-c
Put 'weather_TD.zip' somewhere (e.g. in a folder on the desktop) and unzip it
Point your development environment to this folder
(In Visual Studio code use file-open folder)
From weather_TD/src/app open the file called 'weatherService.ts'
on line 14 change http to https and save the file


Open a command window inside the weather_TD folder and type ng serve -o

Eventually a web server starts and a browser opens, showing the page
Explore the app - enter a city/country combination and submit to see a weather report



Look at the project structure: 
main.td -> 
app.module.ts -> 
app.component.ts
Notice how 'weatherService' is injected as a provider into app.module

Also note how the form is added to app.component.html

Explore the .ts and .html files in the app folder and note the form (with validation)

Routing
Notice <router-outlet> inside form.component.html
Also look at the routes declared inside app.module
See lines 40 and 44 in form.component.ts, which actually make the routing happen

Optional
Generate a new component - at a command prompt type ng generate component my-tag
Then open my-tag.component.html and add some details (e.g. your name)
Open my-tag.component.ts and add a property to store the date (inside the class)
Back in my-tag.component.html bind to this new property (double curly braces)
Open app.component.html and choose somehwere to add the <my-tag> element
In the running app you should see whatever content you added to the html template
Feel free to add further evaluations, property bindings or just plain content

You can also unzip 'review4_TD' and explore another app
