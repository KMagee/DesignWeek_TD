Design Review Exercise 4  see https://pastebin.com/uuB2hr3M
========================  until about 2:20 ish
Continue with the 'es6features.html' file ( https://pastebin.com/bPAr1Qwz )
When the user clicks the button, change the button text to read 'Save Changes'
    btnEdit.innerHTML = 'Save Changes'
Clicking the button when it reads 'Save Changes' should set contenteditable to false
    art.setAttribute('contentEditable', 'false')
You will have to find a way to detect which state the page is in

Now add another <article> tag with a unique id
Put a <h1> tag saying 'Name' and a <h2> tag saying 'Age'
Provide two buttons to	 turn on contenteditable for one or other of these elements
When one element has contenteditable=true make the other element contenteditable=false

Optional
--------
At the moment, all the changes are lost when the page is refreshed
Write code to store the content in localStorage and retrieve it (if it exists)
