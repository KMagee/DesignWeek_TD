===============  a solution: https://pastebin.com/Wjh6QR1N
Coninue with the 'design.html' page (or get it from https://pastebin.com/Grz8icy0)
Set the background-color of the 'timeCode' span based on am/pm (before or after 12)
    let hrs = tc.getHours()
Set the background-color of the whole page based on the month
    let month = tc.getMonth()   // careful - the month array is zero-based
Alternatively, set it based on season (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sept or Oct-Dec)

Optional
--------
Write fields for the user to pick a date, along with a button
    <input type="date" id='dt'>
    <button id='btnGo'>Go</button>
Add a click event listener to the button. 
In the event listener call-back function set background-color of the page as before
You could also write a field for the time and use that to set some css
