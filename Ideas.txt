Project Ideas   see https://pastebin.com/WNvDqYvH
=============
Maybe jointly work in a team with allocated roles

Definately write a short project plan
- aims, modules, technologies
- mvp
- how you will know when it's done

Be clear _why_ you are doing something: what will you be able to show for it?

E.g.
----
- learn product 'x' and build an app that does 'y'
- learn technology/ies and combine to do something
- progress current project to achieve...
- jointly work to produce...
